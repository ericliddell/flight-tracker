<h3>Manual Curation: Grant Wrangler</h3>

<p>Grant information is downloaded from several sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>NIH ExPORTER</b> is a data source provided by the NIH for NIH and VA grants. It is based on the NIH RePORTER. The NIH RePORTER requires a password to access and does not have an API; the NIH ExPORTER allows for public accessibility from a script. This data source sometimes contains grants that are not in the Federal RePORTER (see below).  All internal fields and forms reference this data source as Exporter.</li>
<li>The <b>Federal RePORTER</b> is a data source of all federal grants across the NIH, VA, NSF, CDC, NASA, and several other federal agencies that sponsor scientific grants. It has an API that is publicly available. Non-NIH grants only appear here, and sometimes grants appear here before they appear in the NIH RePORTER/ExPORTER. All internal fields and forms reference this data source as Reporter.</li>
<li><b>Internal Databases</b> are often kept by institutions with a ledger of grant information. These are especially helpful for financial and budgetary analyses. Unfortunately, there is no one central format used by academic institutions. Therefore, connectivity would have to be formulated as described in Adding New Data Sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>After being downloaded, grants are processed and ordered by the overnight summary script. The overnight script combines the grants which have the same base number. (E.g., 5R01CA654321-02 and 5R01CA654321-03 are combined because they have the same base number R01CA654321. 5R01CA777777-04 and 1R01CA123456-01 are not combined because they have different base numbers, R01CA777777 and R01CA123456.) Once combined, the most recent fifteen grants are placed, in order of time, into slots on the <b>Summary</b> form. The algorithm for sorting these out is available in the Codebook.</p>

<p>In addition, the overnight script places each grant into one of many <b>bins</b>. These bins can be used to group things for analysis. The exact algorithm used to place grants into these bins is available in the Codebook. The bins are:
<ul>
<li>Internal K – A starter grant by the institution, funded with internal dollars. The application defaults to three-year terms for these grants, but this can be changed in via the <i>Configure Application</i> page on the <i>General</i> menu. These grants are different from startup packages and may not exist at all institutions.</li>
<li>K12/KL2 – A "group K," using federal dollars but administered internally, with a senior faculty PI and multiple scholars supported at 75% effort. Again, the application defaults to three-year terms for these grants, but this can be changed in via the <i>Configure Application</i> page on the <i>General</i> menu.</li>
<li>Individual K – From the NIH, typically five years in length and supports 75% of a scholar's effort. The application defaults to five-year terms for these grants, but this can be changed in via the <i>Configure Application</i> page on the <i>General</i> menu.</li>
<li>External K – A career development grant from an external source such as the VA or a foundation, but not NIH; typically covers 50-75% of a scholar's effort and ranges from three to five years in length.</li>
<li>R01 – NIH's large project grant. Either an R01 or an R01 Equivalent is required for a scholar to “convert” to research independence.</li>
<li>R01 Equivalent – Defined as $250,000 per year for 3+ years  from any non-NIH source; either an R01 or an R01 Equivalent is required for a scholar to “convert.”</li>
<p class='smaller blockquote'>Over 90% of R01s given nationally fit this definition based on all R01s listed in the NIH RePORTER from 2013-2017. Two other definitions of R01 equivalence were considered and not used. One definition from the NIH with certain activity codes of awards was not used because the definition did not encompass non-NIH grants. Another definition from Cancer.gov of $125,000 per year over three years was not used because $250,000 per year was closer to a data-determined response.</p>
<li>Research Fellowship – We allow this category to be used by a Custom Grant as it is helpful for classification of some grants that may otherwise get incorrectly lumped into one of the K bins. Our algorithm does not place a grant into this category automatically, however; it is used only in manual placement. F30/31/32 grants and similar fellowships use this prior to a scholar's career development (K) award.</li>
<li>Training Grant Admin – This category is used when someone administrates (i.e., is a PI) a grant (e.g., T32 or K12) being used to train other prospective investigators. Typically only those who have converted from K to R and are at the Associate Professor level or higher can be PI on these grants.</li>
<li>K99/R00 – We had trouble with classifying this paired grant as it is more than just a career development award but not at the level of an R01 or equivalent. Therefore, we put in its own category. Being given this grant is not considered “conversion” from K to R, but it is also not considered a K grant; essentially this takes awardees out of the denominator of those who have or have had a K.</li>
<li>N/A – All other grants; these grants are not placed in the fifteen most recent grants. Examples include internally generated grants where someone else is the PI or small external grants or contracts which do not meet the level of funding for an R01 Equivalent, such as an R03 or R21.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our experience, the grant information from the Federal RePORTER and NIH ExPORTER has an error rate of less than one error per every one hundred grants (< 1% of the grants). However, these errors do need to be corrected, hence the grant wrangler interface. To make periodic “grant wrangling” easier for large groups of scholars, we have created a webpage that allows the user to view new grants, if any, for each record for a user-determined number of days. You can view new grants by clicking a separate left-hand menu item while the default view consists of all grants over all time. This allows for review of all new grants in the period without also needing to view all old grants, greatly shortening the time it takes to review the entire population. The program manager is thus able to catch and correct errors such as a grant placed into the wrong bin, grant assigned to the wrong person (i.e., a grant where the scholar is a co-investigator, not the principal investigator), or missing grants. We recommend combing through the new grants about once per month to keep summary data accurate.</p>
