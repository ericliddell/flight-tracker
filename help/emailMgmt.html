<h3>Configuring Emails

<p>Flight Tracker allows you to configure emails for certain audiences within your group of scholars and to include links to REDCap Surveys. Emails will be sent at a certain time individually, with optional name fields to customize the email for the individual scholar.</p>

<h4>Specify Email Name</h4>
<p>You must name your email with a unique name. You can pre-load information from prior emails by selecting it from the dropdown.</p>

<h4>Who?</h4>
<p>The <b>From Email Address</b> must be specified. An example would by <code>joe.user@vumc.org</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, by answering a few questions about your intended audience (i.e., the <b>To</b>), you can filter your list of scholars to only those who fit certain characteristics. Factors to filter are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Individual(s) vs. Filtered Group</b>: Selecting <i>Individual(s)</i> will provide you with checkboxes for each individual so as to select the scholars; selecting a <i>Filtered Group</i> will allow you to specify characteristics of a group.
<li><b>All vs. Some</b>: Selecting <i>All</i> scholars will email your entire population. Selecting <i>Some</i> scholars will provide a few more questions.
<li><b>Have Any Surveys Been Completed?</b> Selecting <i>No</i> will only email scholars who have never completed a survey. Selecting <i>Yes</i> will provide another question.
<ul><li><b>The Scholar Hasn’t Filled Out a Survey in Last X Months</b>: You can provide this number. It must be a whole number. This allows you to screen out people who have recently communicated.</li></ul>
<li><b>What are the Maximum Number of Emails a Scholar Can Receive?</b> Selecting <i>Unlimited</i> will select everyone. Selecting <i>Limit to Number</i> will provide you with a follow-up question.</li>
<ul><li><b>X Emails</b>: You can provide this number. It must be a whole number. Those who have received this number of emails will not receive another email.</li></ul>
<li><b>Has the Scholar Received an R01-or-Equivalent Grant?</b> Selecting <i>No</i> will allow you to address all scholars on the K phase of their career. Selecting <i>Yes</i> will allow you to address all scholars who are on the R phase (i.e., converted) of their career. Selecting <i>Doesn’t Matter</i> will address everyone.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What?</h4>
<p>The <b>Subject</b> specifies the subject of the email.</p>

<p>There is a box with rich-text formatting for you to type in the body of the email. You can insert the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <b>Survey Link</b> to a particular survey. Any REDCap survey in the project can be linked, including the ones you add yourself. <i>It is recommended to send out one email per survey.</i></li>
<li>The <b>Name</b> (full first name and last name) of the scholar</li>
</ul>

<h4>When?</h4>
<p>The <b>Initial Email</b> time can be selected. We have our best response rates on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. This will automatically queue the mass email up.</p>

<p>If desired, a <b>Follow-Up Email</b> can be scheduled to send to non-respondents. Those who have not responded will receive an email with identical text to the first. Those who have responded will not receive any more communication.</p>
