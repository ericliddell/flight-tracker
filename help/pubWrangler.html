<h3>Manual Curation: Publication and Patent Wrangler</h3>

<p>Publications and patents are added via an opt-in method: You must choose to include an item in order for it to factor into Flight Tracker’s computations.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 – Automatic Approvals</strong>. To speed up inclusion of publications and patents, Flight Tracker suggests automatically approving matches that are based on uncommon, long last-names. Uncommon names are names that appear for less than 200,000 Americans in the 2010 US Census. Long last names are longer than four characters.</p>

<p>Automatically approved items appear with a green checkmark. Those recommended to be handled manually appear with a hand. Hopefully, this will expedite a significant segment of your scholars.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 – Manual Approvals</strong>. After automatic approval, remaining scholars are handled one-by-one. You can check or uncheck each item. (They are all checked by default.) The highlighted name appears bolded in the citation.</p>

<p>Names are matched by institution name and by author name. Thus, only last names especially common at your institution might be mismatched. However, certain names are still prone to problems, like Smith, Xu, or Williams. It’s recommended slowing down and handling these cases carefully.</p>

<p>New items appear at the top while already approved items appear at the bottom. If you want to change the approval of an item, you can open it up in REDCap and change the answer to the question “Include?” Yes means approved; No means unapproved; [blank] returns it to the new items queue.</p>

<p>Best practice is to quickly glance through the title and/or journal name of the patent/publication to affirm the field. You can launch an external viewer to glean more details about the item.</p>

<p>Some names are especially prone to mismatch. You can manually exclude a name from matching with a certain scholar by adding it to an Exclude List. This entry, when supported by Flight Tracker, can be modified in a text box at the top of the Wrangler page.</p>

<p>Publications can also be pulled via an ORCID identifier. This is modified on the Identifiers form and may be automatically pulled in via a weekly automated sweep. Publications matched by an ORCID are automatically approved since it does not have the difficult problems of name matching.</p>

<p>PubMed only began tracking institutional information for all authors in late 2014. (Before that, institutional information only for first authors was tracked.) Since institutional information is part of the matching process, publications prior to this will not be automatically added.</p>

<p>If you want to add a new item (from a CV or some other list), you can enter its id (Patent Number, PMID, or PMC-ID) to pull in a citation. If the citation is correct, click the button to include it in your list.</p>

<p>When the wrangling information looks correct, click the green button on the right. This will move the approved new items in your queue to the bottom. Then, you will be moved to the next record with new items. Made a mistake? Please see above on how to override your finalized choices manually via a REDCap data form.</p>
